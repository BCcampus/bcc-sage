## How To Contribute 

###  :wrench: Installing for Development

BCC-Sage is based on the [Sage](https://github.com/roots/sage) WordPress starter theme with a modern development workflow. It uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) for dependency management and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for asset compilation. _Please note: Sage theme development differs greatly form the standard WordPress approach. You can visit the [Sage](https://roots.io/sage/) website for details._

## :construction: Requirements

Make sure all dependencies have been installed before moving on:

* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) >= 4.7
* [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php) >= 7.0
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 6.9.x
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## :bug: Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+repo%3Abccampus%2Fbcc-sage)** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; make sure that the code in the repository is
_definitely_ responsible for the issue. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem [in the latest version of bcc-sage](https://github.com/BCcampus/bcc-sage/releases) running on the [latest version of WordPress](http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress,) and verify if the problem happens with all other plugins deactived.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

## :star: Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the BCcampus developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.


<a name="pull-requests"></a>
## :metal: Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of
time working on something that the developers might not want to merge into the
project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the project (indentation,
comments, etc.).
